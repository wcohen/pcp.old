Instructions for installing Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) from a tarball package

If PCP is delivered as a tarball, there will be 2 compressed tar files:

pcp-<version_number>-<build>.src.tar.gz		all of the source
pcp-<version_number>-<build>.tar.gz		a binary distribution

<version_number> is something like 4.0.0
<build> is an integer.

The first tar file is built in build/tar.

The second is built in pcp-<version_number>-<build>/build/tar.

To install or upgrade, run the following commands as "root" in the
directory where the binary distribution is:

    # ./preinstall
    # here=`pwd`
    # ( cd /; tar xpf $here/pcp-*-[0-9]*.tar.gz )
    # ./postinstall

To remove PCP, run the following command as "root":

    # ./remove
