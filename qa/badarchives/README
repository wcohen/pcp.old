Bad QA archives that are static.  All of these are corrupted in
some manner.

These ones are checked into the git tree.

For some of them, the makefile and the associated pmlogger
configuration files and scripts provide recipes for recreating them.

Others come from sources that are not reproducible, e.g. points in
the past when the code that created the archive was busted.

See also ../archives for good static QA archives and ../tmparch for
the dynamically recreated QA archives.
