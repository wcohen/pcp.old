Revision history for Perl extension PCP::PMDA.

1.17  Fri Aug 25 13:46:10 EST 2017
	- Implement indom cache restoration for hash indoms.
	- Add the load_indom helper function.

1.16  Thu Sep  5 11:22:34 EST 2013
	- Add pmda_install helper function.
	- Make several new PM_ERR error codes available.

1.15  Thu Sep  5 11:22:34 EST 2013
	- Fix a subtle reference counting problem in the hash
	  indom code.
        - Consistently use unsigned type to index the indom
	  table.

1.14  Tue Jul 10 11:40:14 EST 2012
	- Add support for hash-based indom handling via PMDA
	  cache interfaces in libpcp_pmda.  This introduces a
	  routine for looking up opaque PMDA data from instid
	  (pmda_inst_lookup) suitable for fetch callback use.
	- Fix pmda_inst_name interface used by dtsrun PMDA -
	  using an incorrect value for indom lookup.  This is
	  now consistent with the other instance interfaces,
	  and dtsrun PMDA (not widely used) has been fixed.
	- Fix instance interface arguments - no current PMDA
	  makes use of this, but if one did (pmdaoracle will)
	  it would be given the internal indom identifier and
	  not the handle given to all other indom interfaces.
	- Remove unused parameters to internal preinstance()
	  and prefetch() routines, no visible effect for any
	  PMDAs but the wrapper code becomes more readable.
	- Fix help file handling which (for current gcc/perl
	  combinations at least) was using potentially-freed
	  memory.

1.13  Thu Oct 20 11:50:18 EST 2011
	- Add an interface to allow a PMDA to drop privileges.
	- Fix pmda_long and pmda_ulong 32-bit detection.

1.12  Fri Jul 22 11:15:41 EST 2011
	- Ensure local fetch and instance wrapper routines
	  are always called.  Otherwise refresh interface
	  doesn't work, and pmns_refresh may not be called
	  in all situations where it should be.

1.11  Wed May 11 21:04:09 EST 2011
	- Make file tail non-blocking so it can be used for
	  named pipes as well as regular files.

1.10  Thu Nov 25 03:30:18 EST 2010
	- Convert to using dynamic namespace interfaces.
	- Added metric and indom table clearing interfaces.

1.09  Sun Aug  1 09:04:38 EST 2010
	- Fix memory leak in fetch routine string handling.

1.08  Thu Nov 19 10:37:26 EST 2009
	- Fix typo on name export for pmda_inst_name.
	- Add a fast path lookup in pmda_inst_name for direct
	  instance identifier to offset case (common).
	- When tailing logfiles, seek to end initially so we
	  don't spend potentially copious amounts of time on
	  scanning the entire log file - we only want events
	  that happen after PMDA startup to be counted too.

1.07  Fri Aug 21 09:27:51 EST 2009
	- Add helper routines to determine native long sizes.

1.06  Wed Jul 22 12:49:43 EST 2009
	- Ensure the process runs in its own process group,
	  and block SIGTERM in atexit handler.  This resolves
	  a regression in the 1.05 fix for reaping children.

1.05  Tue Jul  8 16:19:49 EST 2009
	- Explicitly free all local temporaries immediately
	  for routines that call Perl from C (fixes memleak).
	- Fix an off-by-one when handling long input lines.
	- Terminate any children started by the PMDA at exit.

1.04  Mon Jul  6 11:08:20 EST 2009
	- Rewrote PMNS file generation to use libpcp routines.

1.03  Wed Jun 10 14:53:05 EST 2009
	- Incorporated Win32 build changes (paths, etc).
	- Remove (unneeded) use of hsearch and <search.h>.

1.02  Tue Jun  2 17:16:25 EST 2009
	- Implemented log file rotation and host reconnect handling.
	- Generally improved the file "tail" mode of operation.

1.01  Fri Feb 13 17:33:31 EST 2009
	- Added simple instance name lookup routine.

1.00  Thu Aug 20 08:48:14 EST 2008
	- Added several API components, 1st stable version.

0.04  Mon Feb 25 15:01:33 EST 2008
	- Smaller, but still incompatible, API refinements.

0.03  Sun Feb 24 09:06:39 EST 2008
	- API changes, moved existing Perl PMDAs out into PCP.

0.02  Wed Feb 20 16:38:38 EST 2008
	- port forward to Perl API changes (circa Perl 5.6).

0.01  Mon Sep 20 09:01:16 EST 1999
	- original version; created by h2xs 1.18
