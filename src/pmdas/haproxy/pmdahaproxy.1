.TH PMDAHAPROXY 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdahaproxy\f1 \- HAProxy PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
\f3pmdahaproxy\f1 is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (\s-1PMDA\s0) which
extracts live performance data from HAProxy statistics socket or URL.
.PP
By default the HAProxy stats socket is used to retrieve the metric but
if the optional URL option is set (see below), then the HAProxy URL
is used instead.
.PP
See the HAProxy documentation for detailed description of each metric.
.PP
.SH INSTALLATION
\f3pmdahaproxy\f1 reads an optional ini-style configuration file
.IP "\(bu" 4
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy/haproxy.conf
.PP
This file can contain in its \f3[pmda]\f1 section overriding values
for the following PMDA options:
.IP "\(bu" 4
user
.IP "\(bu" 4
socket
.PP
By default, \f3root\f1 and \f3/var/lib/haproxy/stats\f1,
are used as values for these options, respectively.
.PP
The section can also contain the following parameters:
.IP "\(bu" 4
url
.IP "\(bu" 4
auth
.IP "\(bu" 4
pass
.PP
When the \f2url\f1 option is defined, URL connection to HAProxy is used.
\f3pmdahaproxy\f1 expects CSV data from the HAProxy URL; an example
of a compatible URL is \f3http://127.0.0.1:9000/?stats;csv\f1.
.PP
Note that the HAProxy statistics socket and/or URL need to be separately
enabled in the HAProxy configuration file; please refer to the HAProxy
configuration documentation for details. Depending on system and HAProxy
configuration, using non-root user may also be possible, especially
with URL based connections.
.PP
Once the needed setup is ready, you can test the connection and install
the PMDA to enable access to the names and values for the HAProxy
performance metrics. To install, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy
.br
      # ./connect
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/haproxy
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmdahaproxy\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
