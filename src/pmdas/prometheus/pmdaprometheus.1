.TH PMDA\*(IA 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmda\*(ia\f1 \- \*(Ia PMDA
.SH SYNOPSIS
\f3$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/\*(ia/pmda\*(ia\f1
[\f3\-c\f1 \f2config\f1]
[\f3\-t\f1 \f2timeout\f1]
[\f3\-u\f1 \f2user\f1]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBpmda\*(ia\fR is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
creates PCP metrics from \*(Ia endpoints, which provide HTTP based
access to application metrics.
The default \f2config\fP directory is \fB$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/urls.d/\fR,
see \fBSOURCES\fP below.
The default URL fetch \f2timeout\fP is \fB2\fP seconds.
The default \f2user\fP, if not specified, is the current user.
.PP
Further details on the \*(Ia exposition format can
be found at
.I https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats

.SH "URL SOURCES"
As it runs,
.B pmda\*(ia
periodically scans the
.I $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus/urls.d
directory, looking for source url files (\c
.IR *.url ).
Each .url file contains one complete HTTP or HTTPS URL at which to
pmda\*(ia is to reach a \*(Ia endpoint.  The server does not
have to be up or stay running.  The pmda will relay data and metadata
when/if they are up, and will return errors when/if they are down.

.SH METRICS
All metrics from a file named
.IR FOO.url
will be exported as PCP metrics with the
.I prometheus.FOO.
prefix.  Therefore, the FOO name must be a valid component for PMNS metric
names.  If the FOO name has multiple dot-separated components, the resulting
PMNS names will present those components.  Users should avoid configurations
with sources that mix levels of nesting, such as
.IR FOO.BAR.url
.IR FOO.BAZ.url
.IR FOO.url
because metrics under FOO one may conflict with or hide FOO.BAR and FOO.BAZ
subtrees.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.B pmda\*(ia
and
.B libpcp
internals impose some numerical constraints about the number of sources (4095),
metrics (1024) within each source, and instance domain instances for each
metric (4194304).

.SH INSTALLATION
Install the \*(Ia PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/prometheus
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
\fBpmda\*(ia\fR is launched by \fIpmcd\fR(1) and should never be executed
directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify \fIpmcd\fR(1) when the
agent is installed or removed.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
