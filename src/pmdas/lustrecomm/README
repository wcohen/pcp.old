lustrecomm PMDA
===============

This PMDA collects statistics common to all lustre implementations,
the statistics found in /proc/lustre and /proc/lnet

Note:
	This PMDA may be remade from source and hence requires a C
	compiler to be installed.

	Uses of make(1) may fail (without removing or clobbering files)
	if the C compiler cannot be found.  This is most likely to
	happen when running the PMDA ./Install script.

	The only remedial action is to install the C compiler, or
	hand-craft changes to the Makefile.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT lustrecomm

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use (see
    $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options -- everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lustrecomm
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/trivial.log) should be checked for any warnings
    or errors.
