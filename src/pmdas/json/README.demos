sample pcp json application
===========================

acme_json.c
 is a sample application that is instrumented with the pcp json
interface to generate metrics available from the JSON PMDA
(Performance Metrics Domain Agent).  It runs without exiting,
and continually updates the json.acme.* metric values.  Detailed
discussion about the workings of this application and each of
the instrumentation API calls it uses, is available as part of
the "Performance Co-Pilot Programmer's Guide".

All source is shipped as part of pcp as well and is installed in
${PCP_DEMOS_DIR}/json.  If you have a C toolchain installed, the
sources and Makefile in this directory may be used to create the
functionally equivalent binaries, by entering the command

	% make acme_json

You will need to add ${PCP_DEMOS_DIR}/json to
${PCP_PMDAS_DIR}/json/config.json and restart the json pmda before
running the demo program.
