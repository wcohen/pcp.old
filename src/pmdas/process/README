Process PMDA
============

This PMDA monitors root processes to see if they are still running.
The processes that are monitored are stored in a config file,
and the PMDA returns the number of root processes with that name
running.  In this way, you can check to see if the number of processes
is in a range, is 1, is 0, or some other combination.

This source code was contributed by Alan Bailey (abailey@ncsa.uiuc.edu)
to the PCP open source project.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT process

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/process

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    ($PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h
    to choose another domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options -- everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/process
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/process.log) should be checked for any warnings or
    errors.
