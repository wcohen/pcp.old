.TH PMDADM 1 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmdadm\f1 \- Device Mapper PMDA
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B pmdadm
is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which exports
metric values for Device Mapper on the local system.
.PP
This PMDA collects its data through the
.BR dmsetup (8)
utility, dmstats API and requires that the program is installed in order to function.
.PP
In addition, at least a statistics region must be created to use
.BR dmstats (8)
in order to get the basic counter value.
.PP
Further details on device mapper can be found at
http://redhat.com
.SH INSTALLATION
Install the DM PMDA by using the Install script as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dm
.br
      # ./Install
.PP
To uninstall, do the following as root:
.PP
      # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/dm
.br
      # ./Remove
.PP
.B pmdadm
is launched by
.BR pmcd (1)
and should never be executed directly.
The Install and Remove scripts notify
.B pmcd
when the agent is installed or removed.

.SH dmstats metric
This PMDA use the dmstats API (the userspace device-mapper support
library) to allow dmstats performance data.
.br
Using this PMDA, users need the userspace device-mapper support library (libdevmapper)
and the userspace command line tool (dmstats).
Before getting the statistics metric, statistics regions have to be created.
When creating the statistics regions of all device-mapper device under /dev/mapper as below:
.PP
	# dmstats create --alldevices
.PP
Further Detail on
.BR dmstats(8)
can be found at man page.
.br
.IP "\fBBasic Counters\fR" 4
Basic counters provide access to the raw counter data from the kernel,
allowing further processing to be carried out by another program.
.br
The Kernel provides thirteen separate counters for each statistics area.
The first eleven of these match the counters provided in /proc/diskstats
or /sys/block/*/*/stat. The final pair provide separate counters for
read and write time.
.RS 4
.IP "\fBdmstats.read\fR" 4
Count of reads completed this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.reads_merged\fR" 4
Count of reads merged this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.read_bytes\fR" 4
Count of kbytes read this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.reads_time\fR" 4
Accumulated duration of all read requests per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.write\fR" 4
Count of writes completed this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.writes_merged\fR" 4
Count of writes completed this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.write_bytes\fR" 4
Count of kbytes write this interval per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.writes_time\fR" 4
Accumulated duration of all write requests per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.in_progress\fR" 4
Count of requests currently in progress per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.io_ticks\fR" 4
Nanoseconds spent servicing request per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.queue_ticks\fR" 4
This field is incremented at each I/O start, I/O completion, I/O merge,
or read of these stats by the number of I/Os in progress multiplied by
the number of nanoseconds spent doing I/O since the last update of
this field. This can provide an easy measure of both I/O completion time
and the backlog that may be accumulating.
.IP "\fBdmstats.read_ticks\fR" 4
Nanoseconds spent servicing reads per device-mapper device.
.IP "\fBdmstats.write_ticks\fR" 4
Nanoseconds spent servicing writes per device-mapper device.

.SH PCP ENVIRONMENT
Environment variables with the prefix \fBPCP_\fR are used to parameterize
the file and directory names used by \fBPCP\fR. On each installation, the
file \fB/etc/pcp.conf\fR contains the local values for these variables.
The \fB$PCP_CONF\fR variable may be used to specify an alternative
configuration file, as described in \fIpcp.conf\fR(5).
