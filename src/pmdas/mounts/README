Mounts PMDA
============

This PMDA exports information about the mount status of file
systems specified in a config file. The default config file is
$PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts/mounts.conf, which should contain one line
for each file system you wish to monitor.

This source code was contributed by Alan Bailey (abailey@ncsa.uiuc.edu)
to the PCP open source project.

Metrics
=======

The file ./help contains descriptions for all of the metrics exported
by this PMDA.

Once the PMDA has been installed, the following command will list all
the available metrics and their explanatory "help" text:

	$ pminfo -fT mounts

Installation
============

 +  # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts

 +  Check that there is no clash in the Performance Metrics Domain
    defined in ./domain.h and the other PMDAs currently in use
    ($PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH).  If there is, edit ./domain.h to choose another
    domain number.

 +  Then simply use

	# ./Install

    and choose both the "collector" and "monitor" installation
    configuration options -- everything else is automated.

De-installation
===============

 +  Simply use

        # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mounts
	# ./Remove

Troubleshooting
===============

 +  After installing or restarting the agent, the PMCD log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/pmcd.log) and the PMDA log file
    ($PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/mounts.log) should be checked for any warnings or
    errors.
