Upgrade checklists for each of the bundled webapps

== general ==

The web applications we ship are prepared, deployable versions.
For most, this means a build of some kind to conver from their
upstream sources to the deployable applications.

== vector ==

- http://vectoross.io/docs/building-vector-source.html
  and in particular:
  $ npm install
  $ bower install
  $ gulp build
  ... the deployable Vector is then in the dist/ directory.

== graphite ==

- Re-build process is not known, but probably related is:
  http://graphite.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development.html

== grafana ==

- Re-build process is not known.  Building current recent grafana
  is documented here (but does not apply to the 1.9.1 version!)
  https://github.com/grafana/grafana/blob/master/README.md

== blinkenlights ==

- This is a static demo, not expected to ever change now, so no
  work to do here.  It does embed versions of jquery & jquery-ui
  however, which may need to be updated someday.
