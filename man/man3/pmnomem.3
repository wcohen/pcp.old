.TH PMNOMEM 3 "PCP" "Performance Co-Pilot"
.SH NAME
\f3pmNoMem\f1 \- report out of memory conditions
.SH "C SYNOPSIS"
.ft 3
#include <pcp/pmapi.h>
.sp
void pmNoMem(const char *\fIwhere\fP, size_t \fIsize\fP, int \fIfatal\fP);
.sp

.SH DESCRIPTION
.BR pmNoMem
is a convenience method that may be used when
.BR malloc (3)
or a related memory allocation service fails.
.PP
A standard message is emitted using
.BR pmNotifyErr (3)
with
.I where
used as a message prefix and the failing allocation
.I size
is also reported.
.PP
If
.I fatal
is zero (and
.B PM_RECOV_ERR
is zero),
.B pmNoMem
returns (the allocation failure is assumed to be recoverable
by the caller), else (and
.B PM_FATAL_ERR
is a good value to use in this case)
.BR exit (2)
is called with an argument of 1.
.SH SEE ALSO
.BR exit (2),
.BR malloc (3),
.BR PMAPI (3)
and
.BR pmNotifyErr (3).
